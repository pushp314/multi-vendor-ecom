# Blueprint: E-commerce Application

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture and features of a modern e-commerce application built with Next.js, Prisma, and Stripe. The application provides a seamless shopping experience, from browsing products to a secure checkout process. It features a robust authentication system, a dynamic shopping cart, and a complete order management system.

## Project Outline

### Authentication

- **Providers:** Users can sign in using their email and password or through their Google account.
- **NextAuth.js:** The application uses NextAuth.js for authentication, with a Prisma adapter for database session management.
- **Protected Routes:** The cart and checkout pages are protected, ensuring that only authenticated users can access them.

### Product Management

- **Prisma Model:** Products are managed through a Prisma `Product` model, which includes fields for name, description, price, and images.
- **Product Seeding:** The database is seeded with initial product data for immediate use.
- **Store Page:** Products are displayed on a dedicated store page, where users can browse and add items to their cart.

### Shopping Cart

- **Dynamic Updates:** The shopping cart is fully dynamic, allowing users to add, remove, and update the quantity of items in real-time.
- **Server Actions:** Cart operations are handled through Next.js Server Actions, providing a seamless and efficient user experience.
- **Detailed Summary:** The cart page displays a detailed summary of the items, including the subtotal, shipping costs, and total amount.

### Checkout

- **Stripe Integration:** The checkout process is powered by Stripe, ensuring secure and reliable payment processing.
- **Payment Element:** The application uses the Stripe Payment Element for a streamlined and customizable checkout form.
- **Order Creation:** Upon successful payment, a new order is created in the database, linking the user, products, and payment details.

### Styling

- **Tailwind CSS:** The application is styled using Tailwind CSS, providing a modern and responsive design.
- **shadcn/ui:** The UI is enhanced with components from the `shadcn/ui` library, ensuring a consistent and polished look and feel.

## Initial Development and Error Resolution

- **Objective:** The initial goal was to fix a series of errors that were preventing the application from functioning correctly.
- **Key Issues Resolved:**
  - **Authentication:** Corrected errors in the NextAuth.js configuration, ensuring that both email/password and Google authentication work as expected.
  - **Checkout Flow:** Migrated the checkout process from Razorpay to Stripe, implementing a complete and secure payment flow.
  - **Database Models:** Fixed inconsistencies in the Prisma models, particularly with the `User` and `Product` schemas.
  - **Cart Functionality:** Built a complete shopping cart experience from the ground up, including components for displaying cart items and a summary of the order.
- **Outcome:** All identified errors were successfully resolved, resulting in a stable and fully functional e-commerce application.
